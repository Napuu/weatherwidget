Map shows lightning strikes from last 12h. Data is from FMI (Finnish Meteorological Institute), so only strikes near Finland are shown.<br>
Clicking specific strike shows how far away it happened from your current location, and time.
Color of the strike indicates how long age it happened. In one hour color fades from red to yellow. More than hour old strikes are yellow.
